PROJECT - 1

Design a project where as an input student will give a static number (between 1 to 6) and then roll the dice which randomly generate some value between 1 to 6. The winning situation arrives when the given static/fixed number exactly same to the number came after rolling the dice.

User can play the game as many numbers of times he wants until user wants to exit, and whenever winning situation occur some scores must be given to the user, and these scores goes on adding if user play this game multiple number of times. Note: Dice contains face valueâ€™s (1 to 6)

Hint: Make use of random.randint() function

(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
